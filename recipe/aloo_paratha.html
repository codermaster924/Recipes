    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Parathas are one of (if not the most) the most popular unleavened flatbreads in the Indian subcontinent, made by
        baking or cooking whole-wheat (atta) dough on a tava, and finishing off with shallow-frying.</p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <h4>Ingrediants</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Mashed potato stuffing</b> – Potatoes are boiled, peeled and then mashed. The mashed potatoes are
            seasoned with herbs, spices and salt, and then are stuffed in a rolled dough before being roasted or fried.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Dough made from whole wheat flour</b> – A basic dough is made with whole wheat flour (atta), salt, oil
            and water. Making this unleavened dough is very easy and you can either knead it with your hands or in a
            stand mixer. Do use the Indian atta which is finely ground flour made in a chakki or a stone mill.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <h5>Make Potato Stuffing</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough
            water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For cooking in a pressure cooker – On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles.
                When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the
                potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
            <li>For cooking in a pan – Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it
                helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster
                than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.

            If you don’t have a potato masher, use a box grater to grate them and then mash the potatoes with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the
            stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
        <ul>
            <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers </li>
            <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
            <li>4. Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like</li>
            <li>
                ½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>

            <li>salt according to your taste</li>
        </ul>

        <li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even
            mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside.

            Do check the taste of the spiced mashed potato stuffing, adjusting the salt, red chilli powder, or dry mango
            powder if needed. </li>
        <p> </p>
        <h5>Make The Dough</h5>
        <li>

            In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or
            to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.

            Note: Be sure to add the water in portions as you go on mixing and kneading the dough. Do not all of the
            water at once.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if
            needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <P> </P>
        <h5>Stuff the flatbreads</h5>
        <li>Pinch two small balls from the dough. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>With a rolling pin, roll them into rounds roughly 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Try making both the discs the
            same size.</li>
        <li> On one of the discs, place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 1 inch empty space from the
            sides.</li>
        <li>Gently place the second circle on top.</li>
        <li>Press and seal the edges with your fingertips. If you are not able to seal the edges, then brush or spread
            some water on the edges and then seal.</li>
        <li> Dust some flour on the stuffed aloo ka paratha and start rolling. Roll the paratha into a round about 7 to
            8 inches in diameter, or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.</li>
        <li>Take the edge and start pleating, joining the pleats in the center.</li>
        <li>When all of the pleats are joined together, it should look like a Chinese dumpling. Be sure to pinch the
            pleats together very well so the filling doesn’t leak out while rolling.</li>
        <li>Press the joined top portion slightly downward to flatten it a bit</li>
        <li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas
            at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft. . When the base
            is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.Spread some
            ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part. Spread some ghee or a neutral
            flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part. Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on
            the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.

            This side has to be cooked more than the previous side Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A
            well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting.</li>
